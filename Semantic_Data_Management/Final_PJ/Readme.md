To get our result, run the follow steps:
1. Create the Graph, run
   ```
   python SDM_Graph_Create.py
   ```
2. Query the graph, run
   ```
   python SDM_Query.py
   ```

The data preprocessed code is attached in create_csv.R

However, it is not necessary to use, since we provide all the generated csv file in directory "dict" for graph creation.
