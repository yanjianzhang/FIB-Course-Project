To get our result, run the follow steps:
1. Create the Graph, run
   ```
   python SDM_Graph_Create.py
   ```
2. Query the graph, run
   ```
   python SDM_Query.py
   ```

The data preprocessed code is attached in create_csv.R. If you are going to use it, download the raw file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FoLd8_36Qsk4kIzgibyxtStOl89p4K2m/view?usp=sharing
We suggest just use the output file for create_csv.R, since all of them are provided in directory "dict" for graph creation.
